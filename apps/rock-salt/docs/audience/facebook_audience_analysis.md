## Topic Signals (needs in the wild)

## Audience Segments to Target
1. **Bands & Musicians**
   - Need: gigs, bandmates, promotion, quick‑contact intake.
   - Data sources: post text + external links + social handles.
2. **Venues / Promoters**

   - Data sources: event links, venue page slugs, booking keywords.
3. **Service Providers**
   - Need: recurring leads (studio, mixing, mastering, video).
   - Data sources: studio keywords, external links, @handles.
4. **Educators**
   - Need: fill lesson slots, clear location / availability.
   - Data sources: lessons keywords + contact fields.

## Competitive Moat Opportunities
- **Verified Profiles**: trust layer for venues/bands/providers.
- **Structured Booking**: Spider Riders + availability slots.
- **Direct Outreach**: normalize socials to feed Claude DM automations.
- **Data Loops**: index who is actively posting and re‑engage them.

## Monetization Hooks
- **Booking access**: priority placement for verified/paid bands.
- **Service directory**: paid listing with verification badge.

2. **Enrich** socials: resolve FB pages → IG/TikTok/YouTube handles.
