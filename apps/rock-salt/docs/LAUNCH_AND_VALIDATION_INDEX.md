# Launch & Validation (Option D) – Index

Use these docs to deploy safely, recruit users, and decide the next phase from real data.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](./LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md) | Pre-launch: env, migrations, RLS, storage, smoke tests, go/no-go. |
| [USER_RECRUITMENT.md](./USER_RECRUITMENT.md) | Who to invite (5–10 artists, 5–10 venues), email templates, onboarding, support. |
| [VALIDATION_PLAN.md](./VALIDATION_PLAN.md) | Metrics to track, feedback questions, usage scenarios, red flags, success criteria for Option C. |
| [MONITORING_GUIDE.md](./MONITORING_GUIDE.md) | What to watch in first 24h, week, month; when to intervene vs. observe. |
| [NEXT_PHASE_DECISION_MATRIX.md](./NEXT_PHASE_DECISION_MATRIX.md) | Data-driven next steps: Option C (booking), Option E (polish), tune algorithm, onboarding, or pause. |

**Suggested order:**  
1. Run [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](./LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md) → deploy.  
2. Use [USER_RECRUITMENT.md](./USER_RECRUITMENT.md) to invite and onboard.  
3. Track and ask feedback per [VALIDATION_PLAN.md](./VALIDATION_PLAN.md).  
4. Monitor per [MONITORING_GUIDE.md](./MONITORING_GUIDE.md).  
5. After 2–4 weeks, use [NEXT_PHASE_DECISION_MATRIX.md](./NEXT_PHASE_DECISION_MATRIX.md) to choose Option C, E, or other.
