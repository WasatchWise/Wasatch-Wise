# User Recruitment Plan – Spider Network Launch

**Goal:** Recruit 5–10 artists and 5–10 venues to use the platform and give feedback.

---

## 1. Target User Profiles

### Artists (5–10)

- **Ideal:** Touring bands or solo acts who already use a paper/PDF rider and want a single link or PDF to send to venues.  
- **Geography:** Start with your network (e.g. Utah/SLC, or regions where you have venue contacts).  
- **Size:** Small to mid-level (e.g. guarantee range $250–$2,500) so compatibility with small venues matters.  
- **Avoid for v1:** Large acts with dedicated tour managers (they need more custom workflows).

### Venues (5–10)

- **Ideal:** Clubs, bars, or small theaters that book touring acts and already deal with riders.  
- **Geography:** Match artist targets so real matches are possible.  
- **Size:** Capacity ~100–800 so compatibility with your test artists is realistic.  
- **Avoid for v1:** Arenas or festivals until the product is proven at smaller scale.

## 2. Invitation Email Templates

### For artists

**Subject:** TheRockSalt Spider Rider – one link for your tour rider

**Body (short):**

Hi [Name],

We built a simple way for touring acts to publish a single Spider Rider (one link + PDF) so venues can see your requirements and compatibility before they reach out.

You get:
- A permanent rider link (e.g. therocksalt.com/book/spider-riders/…)
- A downloadable PDF with a verification hash
- Venues can see how well they match your rider before contacting you

Would you be up for trying it with your next tour? It’s free; we’re in launch and want your feedback.

Sign up / claim your band: [URL]

If you’re in, reply with your band name and I’ll make sure you’re set up.

### For venues

**Subject:** TheRockSalt – see which touring riders match your venue

**Body (short):**

Hi [Name],

We’re launching a Spider Network on TheRockSalt: artists publish riders, and venues can see compatibility (guarantee range, stage size, backline, etc.) before accepting or reaching out.

You get:
- A venue profile so artists see what you offer
- A browse page of riders with compatibility scores for your venue
- Fewer mismatched asks

Would you be willing to add your venue and try the compatibility view? We’re in launch and want your feedback.

Claim your venue: [URL]

If you’re in, reply and I’ll make sure you’re set up.

## 3. Onboarding Documentation

- **Artists:** Point to the band dashboard → Spider Rider tab. “Complete all 5 steps, then Publish. You’ll get a rider code and a PDF.” Link to protocol page if useful: `/spider-network/protocol`.  
- **Venues:** Point to venue dashboard → Capabilities tab. “Complete the 5-step profile; you can Save Draft anytime. Then go to Browse Spider Riders to see compatibility.”  
- **One-pager:** Consider a single PDF or Notion page: “Spider Network – how it works (artists + venues)” with screenshots of publish flow and compatibility view.  

Keep onboarding to “where to go + first action”; avoid long docs.

---

## 4. Support Channel

- **Primary:** One clear channel (e.g. email: spider@therocksalt.com, or a Discord/Slack “Spider Network” channel).  
- **Response:** Aim for < 24 h for “something’s broken” and < 48 h for “how do I…?”  
- **Feedback:** After 1–2 weeks, send the short feedback questions from [VALIDATION_PLAN.md](./VALIDATION_PLAN.md#2-feedback-questions-to-ask-users).  

---

## 5. Recruitment Checklist

- [ ] List 10–15 artist contacts and 10–15 venue contacts.  
- [ ] Personalize subject/opening line for each.  
- [ ] Send artist invites first (so riders exist when venues join).  
- [ ] Send venue invites once at least 2–3 riders are published.  
- [ ] Add each invitee to a simple tracker (name, role, invited date, signed up Y/N, first action).  
- [ ] Schedule feedback survey or short call for week 2.
