A privacy officer asked me last month: *"We're piloting an AI writing tool. Do we need FERPA compliance or COPPA compliance?"*

My answer: *"Probably both. Here's how to tell."*

FERPA and COPPA are the two federal laws that govern student data in K-12. If you're adopting AI tools that process student information — and most do — you need to understand both. Confusing them leads to incomplete vendor vetting, missed risks, and board-level liability when something goes wrong.

## FERPA: Education Records

**FERPA** (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) protects *education records* — information directly related to a student that is maintained by the school or by a party acting on the school's behalf.

**What it covers:** Grades, attendance, disciplinary records, IEPs, assessment results, and — increasingly — any data created or collected through edtech tools the district has adopted.

**Key question:** Does this AI tool create, store, or process data that is part of a student's education record? If yes, FERPA applies. Vendor contracts must specify how they handle, secure, and limit use of that data. Schools must have written agreements (Data Privacy Agreements, or DPAs) with vendors who access education records.

## COPPA: Children Under 13 Online

**COPPA** (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) protects *children under 13* when they use websites, apps, or online services that collect personal information.

**What it covers:** Name, email, location, persistent identifiers (cookies, device IDs), and — in the age of AI — prompts, inputs, and outputs that could identify a child.

**Key question:** Does this AI tool collect personal information from students under 13? If yes, COPPA applies. The vendor needs verifiable parent consent (or must qualify for a "school official" exception when the school has contracted with them). They cannot use that data for advertising or to train models without explicit consent.

## Why AI Tools Often Trigger Both

AI tools in schools typically:

- Process student writing, questions, or prompts (education record + personal information)
- Store usage data and analytics (identifiable to a child)
- May use data to improve models (COPPA has strict rules here)

So a single tool — an AI writing assistant, a chatbot tutor, a grading helper — can implicate both laws. Vendor vetting must address *both* FERPA and COPPA, not one or the other.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Assuming COPPA doesn't apply to schools.**  
COPPA applies to *operators* of online services that collect data from children. Edtech vendors are operators. Schools don't get a blanket pass; they need to ensure vendors comply, especially when students under 13 are using the tool.

**Mistake 2: Assuming FERPA covers all student data.**  
FERPA covers education records. Some data — e.g., certain browsing behavior, non-educational app usage — may fall outside FERPA but still be covered by COPPA or state laws. Don't assume one law covers everything.

**Mistake 3: Skipping the DPA.**  
"No DPA? No pilot." If a vendor can't or won't sign a Data Privacy Agreement that specifies FERPA and COPPA compliance, data handling, retention, and deletion — walk away.

## SDPC Alignment: The Shortcut

The **Student Data Privacy Consortium (SDPC)** maintains model DPAs and compliance frameworks that many edtech vendors have already adopted. A vendor who is SDPC-aligned has pre-negotiated terms that cover FERPA, COPPA, and common state requirements. That doesn't mean you skip due diligence — but it significantly reduces the legwork.

At Ask Before You App, we use WiseBot to assess vendor SDPC alignment. It's one way to quickly identify which vendors have done the privacy homework and which haven't.

## Your Next Step

Before you pilot any AI tool that touches student data, ask:

1. Does it create or process education records? (FERPA)
2. Does it collect personal information from students under 13? (COPPA)
3. Do we have a written DPA that addresses both?
4. Is the vendor SDPC-aligned?
