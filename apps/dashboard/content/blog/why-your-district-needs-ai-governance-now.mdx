If you're a superintendent or district CTO reading this in 2026, here's the uncomfortable truth: **AI is already being used in your schools.** Teachers are using ChatGPT to draft lesson plans. Students are submitting AI-assisted homework. Counselors are experimenting with AI for scheduling. And most of this is happening without a single policy in place.

This is what we call **shadow AI** — unauthorized, unmonitored, and ungoverned use of artificial intelligence tools across your organization. And it's not a future problem. It's a *right now* problem.

## The Cost of Waiting

Many districts are in a holding pattern, waiting for state legislatures or the U.S. Department of Education to issue definitive AI guidance. But here's what that waiting looks like in practice:

- **Student data exposure**: Free-tier AI tools have minimal privacy protections. Every prompt a student types could be training someone else's model.
- **Equity gaps widening**: Tech-savvy families already use AI as a tutor. Districts without AI literacy programs leave everyone else behind.
- **Board liability growing**: When parents discover there's no AI policy, the question isn't *if* it makes the agenda — it's *when*.
- **Teacher burnout accelerating**: Without clear guidelines, teachers are left guessing what's allowed, leading to anxiety and inconsistency across buildings.

## What "AI Governance" Actually Means

Let's demystify this. AI governance for a school district isn't about banning tools or hiring a data scientist. It's three things:

### 1. A Clear Use Policy

A one-page document (yes, one page) that answers: *Who can use what AI tools, for what purposes, with what data?* This isn't a technology plan. It's a trust contract with your community.

### 2. Practical Training

Not a 45-minute PD session where teachers watch someone demo ChatGPT. Real training means:
- Hands-on workshops where teachers build AI-assisted lesson plans
- Scenario-based exercises: "A parent calls about their child using AI on an essay — what do you say?"
- Admin-specific sessions on procurement, vendor vetting, and incident response

### 3. A Vendor Vetting Framework

Your district probably uses 50–200 edtech tools. How many of them have embedded AI features that launched *after* your last review? A lightweight vendor assessment — even a 5-question checklist — puts you back in control of what AI is touching student data.

## The 90-Day Path Forward

At WasatchWise, we've built a protocol specifically for districts that need to move fast without cutting corners:

- **Days 1–30**: Cognitive Audit — we map your current AI landscape, stakeholder concerns, and regulatory exposure
- **Days 31–60**: Policy + Training Sprint — a board-ready AI use policy and role-specific training delivered to your team
- **Days 61–90**: Operationalize — vendor vetting workflows, incident playbooks, and a measurement baseline so you can prove progress to your board

The districts that act now aren't just avoiding risk. They're building a competitive advantage in talent recruitment, parent trust, and student outcomes.

## Your Next Step

If you're seeing shadow AI, parent questions about ChatGPT, or board members forwarding AI headlines — those are your signals. Don't wait for a crisis to become your catalyst.
