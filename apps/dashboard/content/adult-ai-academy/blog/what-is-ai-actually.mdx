If you've been avoiding AI because it sounds like science fiction—or you've tried ChatGPT once and left confused—you're not alone. This post is for you.

## AI in One Sentence

**AI (artificial intelligence)** here means software that can do tasks we usually associate with human thinking: understanding language, answering questions, summarizing text, or generating new text or images from a prompt. The systems you hear about—ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot—are *not* sentient. They don't "know" things the way you do. They predict the next best token (word or piece of word) or pixel based on huge amounts of data they were trained on.

So when we say "AI," we're really talking about **very capable pattern-matching and generation tools**. Useful? Yes. Magic? No.

## Why This Matters for You

Once you see AI as a tool rather than a mind, a few things get easier:

- **You can judge when to trust it.** Outputs can be wrong, biased, or outdated. Knowing it's pattern-matching helps you double-check instead of assume.
- **You can learn in small steps.** You don't need to "understand AI" in the abstract—you can learn one use case at a time (e.g., "help me draft an email" or "summarize this article").
- **You keep agency.** You decide what to use, when, and with what data. That's the core of AI literacy.

## What's Next

In future posts we'll cover: one prompt trick that changes how you use ChatGPT, AI for lesson planning (for educators), and when to trust—or not trust—AI outputs. If you're ready to go deeper, check out our **Courses** for structured learning.
