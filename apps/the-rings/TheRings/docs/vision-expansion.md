# The Rings at Fullmer Legacy Center
## Expanded Vision: Cradle to Grave Community Development

---

## The Name

**RINGS** = **R**elationships that **I**nspire, **N**urture, and **G**uide your **S**tory

Named after Gene Fullmer, world middleweight boxing champion from West Jordan, Utah. The "Rings" evokes both the boxing ring (discipline, training, earning your way) and the nine developmental rings that radiate outward from self to world.

## Core Philosophy

### Agency Over Surveillance
All data collection is user-initiated. Champions (users) choose to "Tap In" and "Drop Loot." We track growth, not compliance.

### HOMAGO for Everyone
Not just youth—adults HOMAGO too:
- **Hanging Out** → Exposure, social connection, trying things casually
- **Messing Around** → Experimentation, skill-building, making mistakes
- **Geeking Out** → Deep mastery, portfolio-worthy work, expertise

A mom at paint night is Hanging Out. When she starts coming weekly and trying new techniques, she's Messing Around. When she's teaching others and selling her work, she's Geeking Out.

### Building Used All Day
A facility that only operates 3-8pm is economically unsustainable. The Rings operates from morning to night, serving different populations throughout the day.

## The Nine Rings of Development

Growth isn't one-dimensional. We track development across nine expanding rings—for youth AND adults:

| Ring | Description | Example (Youth) | Example (Adult) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Self** | Identity, values, emotional regulation | Journaling, mindfulness | Therapy groups, self-reflection |
| **Brain** | Learning, problem-solving, creativity | Coding, robotics | AI classes, language learning |
| **Body** | Physical fitness, nutrition, movement | Boxing, dance | Yoga, nutrition workshops |
| **Bubble** | Family, close relationships, home | Family projects | Parenting classes, couples events |
| **Scene** | Friends, peers, social dynamics | Crew-based quests | Social gatherings, meetups |
| **Neighborhood** | Local community, immediate surroundings | Neighborhood service | Block parties, local advocacy |
| **Community** | Civic engagement, service organizations | Youth council | Tax help, voter registration |
| **World** | Global awareness, cultures, world events | Cultural exchange | International nights, language |

## Community Asset Mapping

Everyone has something to contribute. The platform should track not just what people are learning, but what they can teach.

**Examples:**
- Dad who's a plumber → Teaches basic home repair
- Teenager who's fluent in Spanish → Tutors adults in English class
- Retired teacher → Mentors youth in writing
- College student → Leads coding workshops

This creates a **gift economy** within the community—people aren't just consumers of services, they're contributors.
