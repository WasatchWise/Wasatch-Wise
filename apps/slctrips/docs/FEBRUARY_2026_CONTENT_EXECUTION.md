**SLC Trips Social Media Strategy**

*Created: February 2, 2026 (Groundhog Day)*

## Executive Summary

**Perfect timing:** Stable bluebird conditions this week (Feb 2-8) create ideal filming environment. Pattern change next week brings fresh snow storytelling. This two-week arc supports both immediate ski content AND natural transition to spring national parks for late February.

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Weekly Rotation:**
- Week 1 (Feb 2-8): Featured = Alta or Park City (bluebird content)
