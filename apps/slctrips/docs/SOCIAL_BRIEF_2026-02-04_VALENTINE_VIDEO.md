# Social Brief — Valentine TripKit 22-Second Video

**Date:** Wednesday, February 4, 2026 · 11:06 AM  
**Asset:** 22-second video (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram)  
**Purpose:** Launch the Valentine’s TripKit as the lead asset; drive traffic to the TripKit page and link-in-bio.

## Recommendation: Post today — aim for 12:00 PM

**Should you post now (11:06)?** You can. For maximum reach on TikTok, **12:00–12:30 PM** is the account’s peak window (audience data: ~12pm–1pm). So:

- **Option A (recommended):** Schedule for **12:00 PM** on all three platforms. Use the next ~1 hour to lock in link, caption, and hashtags.
- **Option B:** Post **now** (11:06). You still get a full day of exposure and 10 days before Valentine’s Day (Feb 14). Slightly before peak is fine; don’t hold for perfect timing.

**Bottom line:** Post **today** (Feb 4). If you can wait ~1 hour, go at **12:00 PM**. If you want it live immediately, post now.

## What to do before you post

### 1. Link (use on each platform)

**TripKit page with UTM by platform:**

| Platform  | URL |
|-----------|-----|
| TikTok    | `https://www.slctrips.com/tripkits/valentines-getaways?utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=slctrips-valentines` |
| Instagram | `https://www.slctrips.com/tripkits/valentines-getaways?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=slctrips-valentines` |
| Facebook  | `https://www.slctrips.com/tripkits/valentines-getaways?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=slctrips-valentines` |

- **TikTok:** Link in bio (single link) or pin a comment: “Full guide 👉 [short link or slctrips.com/tripkits/valentines-getaways]”.
- **IG/FB:** Link in bio; Stories can use link sticker to same URL.

### 2. Caption (short version)

- **Hook:** E.g. “20 romantic road trips from Salt Lake — plus staycation + singles guide. Valentine’s sorted. 💕”
- **CTA:** “Link in bio” or “Full guide in bio” / “Get the full TripKit at slctrips.com”.

### 3. Hashtags (pick 5–8)

- **Always:** `#ValentinesDay` `#UtahTravel` `#SaltLakeCity` `#SLCTrips`
- **Add:** `#RomanticGetaway` `#DateIdeas` `#SLCLife` `#RoadTrip`

### 4. Link-in-bio

- **This week:** Feature **Valentine’s TripKit** as the first/top link so the 22-second video and bio align.
- Later you can rotate back to “Ski Destinations” or “Featured TripKit” per the February content plan.

## Why this timing works

- **Valentine’s Day:** Feb 14 (Saturday) — 10 days out is ideal for “plan your weekend” and “get the guide” without feeling last-minute.
- **Account momentum:** TikTok views +226% in the last 7 days; posting 3–5x/week is the current strategy — this counts as a strong TripKit-led post.
- **Proven angle:** “5 romantic road trips” previously did **36K views**; this video is the same romance/road-trip lane with a direct TripKit CTA.
- **22 seconds:** Fits TikTok/Reels; short enough for completion and strong for “link in bio” follow-through.

## After you post

- **Pin a comment** (TikTok/IG) with the link or “Full guide in bio” to keep the CTA visible.
- **Reply to comments** (“Which one are you doing for Valentine’s?” / “Link in bio for all 20”) to boost engagement and clicks.
- **Weekly sync:** Note this post in the next SMM report (link + platform + campaign `slctrips-valentines`) and check Awin/analytics for clicks and TripKit page visits with `utm_campaign=slctrips-valentines`.
