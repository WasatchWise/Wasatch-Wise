# Homepage Audit — Clutter, Messaging, Flow

**Goal:** One clear story, minimal clutter, strong CTAs.

---

## Current structure (top → bottom)

| # | Section | Purpose |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Hero** | Search, H1 "1 Airport • 1000+ Destinations", subcopy, 2 CTAs (Explore Destinations, Get Your TripKit), **+ BookYourAdventure compact** (Rent a Car, Hotels) |
| 2 | **How far do you want to go?** | Drive-time pills, RandomDestinationPicker, Dan + Bullseye |
| 3 | **Meet the Guardians** | Full block: badge, H2, paragraph, 3 value cards, CTA, fine print |
| 4 | **Curated TripKits carousel** | Thematic TripKit cards |
| 5 | **Book Your Adventure** | Full affiliate section (cars, hotels) |
| 6 | **This Week's Picks** | Dynamic picks grid |
| 7 | **Meet Dan** | Dan image, audio, **4 paragraphs** of copy |
| 8 | **Trust Signals** | Stars, trips planned, "Funofficial Partner" + email |
| 9 | **Why SLCTrips?** | 3 bullets: Destinations, TripKits, Guardians |

## Issues

### Clutter
- **Hero:** Three CTAs in one block (Explore, TripKit, Rent a Car, Hotels). BookYourAdventure compact competes with primary messaging.
- **Book Your Adventure twice:** Compact in hero + full section later. Affiliate appears before user has engaged with the product.
- **Meet Dan:** Four paragraphs is long for a mascot block; risk of skip.
- **Trust + Why SLCTrips?:** Two sections that both recap value; could be one tighter block.

### Messaging
- **TripKit** appears in hero CTA, Guardians section, carousel, and "Why SLCTrips?" — clear but repeated. Carousel + one strong CTA may be enough.
- **Primary CTA** should be unmistakable. Right now "Explore Destinations" and "Get Your TripKit" are equal weight; hero could emphasize one (e.g. Explore) and let carousel + nav carry TripKits.
- **"Adventure Awaits"** is generic; could stay or swap for something more specific (e.g. "From SLC Airport").

### Flow
- **Section count (9)** is a lot. Scrolling feels long; some users may never reach Picks or Dan.
- **Order** is logical (hero → how to explore → free TripKit → paid TripKits → book → picks → Dan → trust). Possible tweak: move "This Week's Picks" higher (e.g. after carousel) so fresh content appears sooner.

## Recommendations (implemented or optional)

| Priority | Change | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Done** | Remove BookYourAdventure compact from hero | One clear hero: search + H1 + two CTAs. Affiliate lives in one dedicated section below. |
| **Done** | Shorten Meet the Guardians intro | One short sentence; 3 cards kept. |
| **Done** | Shorten Meet Dan to 2 paragraphs + sign-off | Keeps voice, reduces scroll. |
| **Done** | Merge Trust + Why SLCTrips into one section | "Why SLCTrips?" (3 bullets, smaller) + trust line (rated, trips, partner + email) at bottom. Fewer sections. |
| Optional | Move "This Week's Picks" above Book Your Adventure | Picks = content; Book = commercial. Content before affiliate can feel better. |
| Optional | Hero: single primary CTA "Explore Destinations", secondary "TripKits" as text link | Clear hierarchy. |
