# SLC Trips Social — Plan Post-10:36

**Date:** Thursday, February 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Make the Valentine push and Week 1 actually move the needle. Clear actions, clear owners, no drift.

---

## Where we are

| Platform | Valentine post (Feb 4) | Issue |
|----------|------------------------|--------|
| **TikTok** | 132 views, 3 likes, 1 save, 2 shares. Pinned link ✅ | Working. Not scaling yet. |
| **Instagram** | 4 views, 3 accounts reached; direct-link comment added Feb 5 | Still minimal reach. |
| **Facebook** | 17 views, 9 viewers, 1 click, 1 share. Link comment ✅ | Middle performer; 100% followers. |

**Valentine’s Day = Feb 14 (Saturday).** We have ~9 days to turn views/saves into TripKit clicks and Awin conversions.

---

## The plan (three phases)

### Phase 1 — Fix and measure (today → Friday Feb 7)

**Objective:** No more “we should…” — do the fixes and close the measurement gap.

| # | Action | Owner | Done when |
|---|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Add pinned comment on Instagram** with the direct Valentine link (UTM `utm_source=instagram&utm_campaign=slctrips-valentines`). | SMM | ✅ Done Feb 5 — first comment live with full link; pin on app if desired. |
| 2 | **Gather Facebook metrics** for the same Valentine post; add to snapshot. | SMM / intern | ✅ Done Feb 5 — 17 views, 9 viewers, 1 click, 1 share; full table in snapshot. |
| 3 | **Run one more snapshot** (Fri Feb 7 EOD): TikTok + IG + FB. Same format as spec. Compare to Thu baseline. | SMM / intern | `SOCIAL_SNAPSHOT_2026-02-07_VALENTINE.md` (or append) exists. |
| 4 | **Check Awin/analytics** for `utm_campaign=slctrips-valentines`: clicks and TripKit page visits. Log the number. | SMM | One number: “X clicks to Valentine TripKit since Feb 4.” |

**Success for Phase 1:** Instagram has a real CTA. We have TikTok + IG + FB + site data. We have a second snapshot for trend.

**What Friday’s snapshot (Feb 7) will tell us:**

| If… | Then… |
|-----|--------|
| TikTok grows (132 → 200+) | Organic algorithm is picking it up → double down on TikTok strategy. |
| Facebook grows (17 → 30+) | Follower base is engaging → Facebook is a viable channel. |
| Instagram stays flat (4 → under 10) | Confirms need for Phase 2 fix (timing or paid boost). |
| Instagram jumps (4 → 20+) | Direct-link comment worked → keep first-comment strategy. |

Baseline to compare: **153 total views** (TikTok 132, Facebook 17, Instagram 4). Link setup: all three ✅.

### Phase 2 — Optimize the Valentine asset (Fri Feb 7 → Wed Feb 12)

**Objective:** Get more reach and more intent (saves, clicks) from the same video without reinventing it.

**TikTok (double down)**  
- **Action:** Reply to every comment within a few hours. Use the brief’s lines: “Which one are you doing for Valentine’s?” / “Link in bio for all 20.”  
- **Action:** If you have capacity, post a **short follow-up** (e.g. 15–30 sec): “That Valentine TripKit you’ve been saving — link in bio, 20 getaways under 4 hours from SLC.” Reuse the same UTM link. Drives second wave.  
- **Metric to watch:** Saves and shares. More saves = more intent.  

**Instagram (stop the bleed)**  
- **Action:** Pinned comment is in Phase 1. After that: **test timing.** Next Reel (any content), post in the **12:00–1:00 PM** window (match TikTok peak). Note in snapshot.  
- **Action:** On the next post, use **first comment** with link + “Full guide 👉” so the algorithm has a clear CTA.  
- **Optional:** One **paid boost** on the Valentine Reel ($20–50, target Utah + travel interest) if organic is still dead by Mon Feb 10. Decide in Week 1 review.  

**Facebook**  
- **Action:** Once we have Phase 1 numbers, if Facebook has any reach at all, add a **pinned or first comment** with the Facebook UTM link. If it’s zero, don’t spend time here this round.  

**Success for Phase 2:** TikTok saves/clicks up week-over-week. Instagram not stuck at 4 views (either organic or one small boost). We know Facebook’s role.

---

### Phase 3 — Week 1 Report and next content (by Feb 9, then ongoing)

**Objective:** Ship the Week 1 Report with real data and lock the next posts so we don’t stall.

| # | Action | Owner | Done when |
|---|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Week 1 Report** (FEBRUARY_2026_CONTENT_EXECUTION template): Content Posted (Valentine links for TikTok, IG, FB), Performance Snapshot (from snapshots), Comment themes, Awin clicks for `slctrips-valentines`, Insights, Next week plan. | SMM | Doc updated and shared by **Feb 9**. |
| 2 | **Decide next 2 posts** from February plan: e.g. Alta 60" or Snowbird $50 hack or Alta vs Park City. Schedule for Week 2 (Feb 9–15). | SMM | Two posts chosen + dates. |
| 3 | **Snapshots after Feb 9:** Weekly (e.g. every Monday) for Valentine until Feb 14; then per SMM sync. Same format. | SMM / intern | Process written down (who, when, where). |

**Success for Phase 3:** Week 1 Report is done. We’re not “waiting to see” — we’re already scheduling Week 2 content.

## Optimization levers (use these when you review)

| Lever | What to try | When |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **TikTok timing** | Post in 12:00–12:30 PM window. | Every post. |
| **TikTok follow-up** | Second post that points to same TripKit/link. | When first post has saves but views plateau. |
| **Instagram timing** | 12:00–1:00 PM, match TikTok. | Next Reels. |
| **Instagram CTA** | Pinned/first comment with link on every Reel. | Every post. |
| **Instagram paid** | Small boost ($20–50) on one Reel to test. | If organic still &lt;20 reach by Feb 10. |
| **Comments** | Reply fast; use “Which one?” / “Link in bio for all 20.” | Whenever comments appear. |
| **Awin** | If clicks &gt;0, which page/destination converts? Double down there. | Weekly. |

## How we know it’s getting better

- **TikTok:** Views and saves up vs. Thu Feb 5 snapshot (132 views, 1 save). More comments = more reply opportunities.  
- **Instagram:** Not still at 4 views. Either organic lift or one boosted run with measurable reach.  
- **Site:** Awin/analytics shows clicks (and ideally conversions) for `slctrips-valentines`.  
- **Process:** Week 1 Report exists. Next posts are scheduled. No “what do we post next?” on Feb 10.

This is the plan. Execute Phase 1 this week; Phase 2 and 3 run in parallel so the report and next content don’t wait.
