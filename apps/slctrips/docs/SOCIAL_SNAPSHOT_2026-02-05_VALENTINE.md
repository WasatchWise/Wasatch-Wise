## Observations (10:36 meeting + Phase 1 execution)

1. **TikTok ahead** — 132 views vs Facebook 17 vs Instagram 4; TikTok 8× Facebook, 33× Instagram. For You traffic driving TikTok.
2. **Facebook middle performer** — 17 views, 9 unique viewers, 1 click (likely TripKit), 1 share; 100% followers; link comment live.
3. **Instagram still minimal** — 4 views, 3 accounts reached; direct-link comment added Feb 5; may need timing/boost (Phase 2).
4. **Link setup complete** — All three platforms have UTM-tracked link in comment (TikTok pinned, IG first comment, FB comment).
5. **Saves** — TikTok has 1 save (purchase-intent signal per VALENTINES_RESEARCH_2026). Watch for growth.

**Next run:** Daily until Feb 9 (Week 1 Report), then per SMM weekly sync. Compare day-over-day to see weekend traction before Valentine’s (Feb 14).
