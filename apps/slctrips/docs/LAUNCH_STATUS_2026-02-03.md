**Team:** SLC Trips  
**Context:** Full-force launch readiness with **Valentine TripKit video** leading the way.  
**Assessment:** Fresh status run against the launch rubric and punch list.

---

## Executive summary

**Verdict: GO.**  
Product is launch-ready. Valentine’s TripKit is live; rubric and control run (Feb 2) both scored **GO** (92–93/100). Punch list complete; no critical blockers. Confidence to launch full force with the Valentine TripKit video as the lead asset is justified.

## Rubric snapshot (baseline)

| Source | Date | Section avg | Bonus | Overall | Verdict |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|---------|--------|
| [LAUNCH_RUBRIC_GO_NO_GO.md](./LAUNCH_RUBRIC_GO_NO_GO.md) | 2026-02-02 | 82 | +10 | **92** | GO ✅ |
| [LAUNCH_RUBRIC_CONTROL_RUN.md](./LAUNCH_RUBRIC_CONTROL_RUN.md) | 2026-02-02 | 83 | +10 | **93** | GO ✅ |

Control run (independent, production) confirmed and slightly exceeded baseline. No drift.

## Lead asset: Valentine TripKit

- **TripKit:** Valentine’s Getaways (`valentines-getaways`) — live.
- **Content:** 20 romantic road trips from SLC + staycation guide + singles guide; Presidents’ Day weekend (Feb 14–16, 2026).
- **Positioning:** Seasonal hook, clear value; “Valentine TripKit video” as lead creative for launch is appropriate.

## Section scores (from last run — no re-score today)

| # | Section | Score |
|---|---------|-------|

## Pre-launch caveats (non-blocking)

- **Stripe / env:** Pre-launch checklist calls for confirming production `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and testing a paid TripKit buy flow (sign-in → Stripe Checkout → payment → access). If not yet done, do one paid test before heavy promotion.
- **Dan:** Global Dan (floating) is in layout; in-TripKit Dan on TripKit pages. Rubric scores “Dan Experience” on written personality; chat is noted, not a launch blocker.

---

## Recommendation

**Launch full force.**  
Valentine TripKit video as lead, homepage and carousel in place, This Week’s Picks live, punch list complete. Run traffic, learn from real usage, and iterate.
