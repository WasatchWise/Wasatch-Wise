## Link Strategy

### Where to Send Traffic

**DO:** Link directly to destination pages or TripKits
**DON'T:** Link to homepage (too many clicks to conversion)

| Content Type | Link To |
|--------------|---------|
| Destination video (Alta, Moab, etc.) | `/destinations/[destination-slug]` |
| TripKit promo | `/tripkits/[tripkit-slug]` |
| "Where to stay" content | Destination page (has hotel CTA) |
| Road trip content | TripKit with car rental CTA |
| Activity/tour content | Destination page (has Viator CTA) |

### Link in Bio Setup

Recommended structure:
```
linktr.ee/slctrips (or similar)
├── Featured TripKit (seasonal)
├── Ski Destinations (winter)
├── National Parks (spring/summer)
└── Welcome Wagon (relocators)
```

Rotate featured link based on current content push.

### UTM Parameters

Add to all links for tracking:

```
?utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=slctrips-[destination]
```

Examples:
- Alta video: `slctrips.com/destinations/alta?utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=slctrips-alta`
- Moab TripKit: `slctrips.com/tripkits/moab-adventure?utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=slctrips-moab`

## Reading Awin Data

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Means | Good Benchmark |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Clicks | Users clicked affiliate link | More = more traffic |
| Conversions | Completed bookings | 1-3% of clicks |
| Commission | Your earnings | Varies by booking value |
| EPC (Earnings Per Click) | Revenue efficiency | Higher = better content targeting |

### What to Look For

1. **High clicks, low conversions** → Traffic is there, but wrong audience or weak destination page
2. **Low clicks, high conversions** → Good audience match, need more traffic
3. **One destination outperforming** → Double down on content for that destination
4. **Hotels vs Activities gap** → Adjust CTA prominence or content angle

### When to Pivot

- If ski content stops converting → shift to spring/parks content
- If one destination dominates → create content series around it
- If car rentals outperform hotels → emphasize road trip content
