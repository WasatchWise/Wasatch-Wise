# Ask Before You App — Audiences

**Scope:** This doc describes **audiences** (who we serve) *inside* the Ask Before You App campaign. These are not civilization-level "realms" like WasatchVille—they are audience segments *within* ABYA.

---

## Terminology: "Realm" vs "Audience"

- **Realm** (in this codebase): Reserved for **top-level business/client deployments** in `civilization/realms/` (e.g. WasatchVille). One realm = one "city" / client.
- **Audience** (in ABYA): The segments we design for *inside* this app: Parent, Educator, Administrator, Student, Just learning. We do *not* call these "realms" in docs or UI to avoid overloading the word "realm."

So: **Student is an audience of Ask Before You App, not a realm of WasatchVille.**

## Audiences (Who Are You?)

| Audience        | Who they are                         | Primary hub section |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Parent          | Caregivers who want to know what apps touch their kids' data | #apps |
| Educator        | Teachers, tech leads who vet tools  | #apps, #certification |
| Administrator   | District/org leaders, policy & compliance | #state-laws |
| Student         | K–12 (and beyond) whose data is in school apps | #apps |
| Just learning   | Anyone curious; verify before you trust | #apps |

## Student (audience)

- **Why it matters:** Students' data is in the apps schools use. They (and those supporting them) deserve a clear place in the campaign.
- **Touchpoints:** Who Are You modal ("Student"), home page card, Knowledge hub ("I'm a student").
- **Outcome:** Students see themselves represented and can learn what to ask and what their rights are—so they're not in the dark.

No separate "Student realm" exists at the civilization level; Student is an ABYA audience only.
