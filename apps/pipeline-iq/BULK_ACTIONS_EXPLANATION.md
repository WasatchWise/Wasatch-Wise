# Bulk Actions Explanation

## What are the Checkboxes For?

The checkboxes allow you to **select multiple projects at once** to perform bulk operations. This saves time when you need to update many projects at the same time.

## What Do the Status Buttons Mean?

These buttons update the **`outreach_status`** field on projects, which tracks where each project is in your sales pipeline:

### 1. **"Mark as Contacted"** (Blue button with phone icon)
- **What it does**: Sets status to `contacted`
- **When to use**: After you've reached out to them (sent an email, made a call, sent a LinkedIn message, etc.)
- **Meaning**: "I've made initial contact with this project"

### 2. **"Mark as Qualified"** (Green button with checkmark icon)
- **What it does**: Sets status to `qualified`
- **When to use**: When they've responded positively or shown real interest
- **Meaning**: "This is a real opportunity worth pursuing"

### 3. **"Archive"** (Red button with archive icon)
- **What it does**: Sets status to `archived`
- **When to use**: When a project is not relevant, dead end, wrong fit, or you're not pursuing it
- **Meaning**: "Hide this from active pipeline"

## How It Works

1. **Select projects**: Click checkboxes next to projects you want to update
2. **Bulk action bar appears**: Shows how many projects are selected
3. **Click a status button**: Updates all selected projects at once
4. **Projects update**: The status column changes to reflect the new status

## Example Workflow

1. You send emails to 20 projects
2. Select all 20 projects using checkboxes
3. Click "Mark as Contacted" 
4. All 20 projects now show "Contacted" status
5. Later, 5 of them respond positively
6. Select those 5 projects
7. Click "Mark as Qualified"
8. Those 5 now show "Qualified" status

## Is This Automatic?

**No, these are manual actions.** You (Mike) click these buttons to track your progress. The system doesn't automatically change statuses - you control when to mark projects as contacted, qualified, or archived.

## Status Meanings Summary

- **New** (gray): Just scraped, haven't contacted yet
- **Contacted** (blue): You've reached out to them
- **Qualified** (green): They've shown interest, real opportunity
- **Archived** (red): Not pursuing, hide from active view

This is your **sales pipeline tracker** - it helps you see at a glance which projects are at which stage of your outreach process.
