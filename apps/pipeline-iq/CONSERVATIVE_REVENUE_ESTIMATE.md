# 🛡️ Conservative Revenue Estimates

**Date:** December 12, 2025
**Based on:** Current architectural knowledge, `REVENUE_PROJECTIONS.md`, and `REVENUE_SHARE_PROJECTIONS.md`.

## 📉 Executive Summary

Based on the dual-revenue model (SaaS Platform + Service Revenue Share), the conservative estimate for Year 1 revenue is **$256,000**.
This assumes lower conversion rates, slower pipeline growth, and execution challenges common in early-stage deployments.

## 💰 Dual Revenue Streams

Your revenue is generated from two distinct engines:

1. **PipelineIQ SaaS**: Subscription revenue from users of the software.
2. **Groove Revenue Share**: $1,000 commission for each service sold by Groove (e.g., WiFi, Cabling) to leads generated by the platform.

## 📅 Year 1 Conservative Breakdown

### 1. SaaS Revenue (PipelineIQ)

*Assumption: Slower adoption, relying mostly on "God Mode" usage and slow word-of-mouth.*

* **Projected ARR:** **$88,000**
* **Key Drivers:**
  * **Paying Customers:** ~60 by end of year (vs 85 moderate).
  * **Adoption:** Primary growth from "Pro" tier ($99/mo), with slower uptake on "Premium" ($299/mo).
  * **Churn:** Calculated at a higher initial rate due to product maturity.

### 2. Revenue Share (Commission)

*Assumption: Lower close rates (25%) and fewer services per customer (3.5 avg).*

* **Projected Revenue:** **$168,000**
* **Pipeline Math:**
  * **Leads Processed:** 1,600 (80% of target).
  * **Meetings Booked:** ~192 (12% conversion).
  * **Deals Closed:** ~48 (25% close rate).
  * **Services Sold:** 168 (3.5 per deal).
  * **Commission:** 168 * $1,000 = $168,000.

### 🏁 Year 1 Total: $256,000

*(Combined Monthly Average: ~$21,300/mo)*

## 🔮 Three-Year Conservative Outlook

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SaaS ARR** | $88,000 | $245,000 | $509,000 |
| **Revenue Share** | $168,000 | $420,000 | $840,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$256,000** | **$665,000** | **$1,349,000** |

*Note: Year 2 and Year 3 assume the launch of the public marketing site and established "standard operating procedures" for the sales team.*

---

## ⚠️ "Baseline Survival" Scenario (Worst Case)

*If marketing fails and growth is restricted strictly to the current active Groove deployment without external SaaS sales.*

* **SaaS Revenue:** ~$0 - $12,000 (Nominal, assuming mostly internal/free use).
* **Revenue Share:** **$84,000**
  * Assumes 50% performance of the conservative model (24 deals closed/year).
* **Total Baseline:** **~$96,000**
  * *Even in this "failure to launch" scenario, the system generates nearly six figures solely through internal utility.*

## 💡 Recommendation

Focus heavily on the **Revenue Share** mechanics in Month 1-3.

* **Why:** It is the immediate cash flow driver ($168k vs $88k).
* **Action:** Ensure the "Scrape → Email → Meeting" pipeline is air-tight for Mike's team. The SaaS revenue is a multiplier that kicks in later.
