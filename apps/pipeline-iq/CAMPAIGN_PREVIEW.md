Hi Partner,

I’m not sure if this is relevant to you right now, but I noticed Stadium View Apartments in Santa Clara, CA is moving into Pre-Construction.

Typically, once the shell is underway, teams start wrestling with coordination and schedule risk.

Are you already set with a unified plan to handle Wi‑Fi/internet, TV, access control, and low‑voltage — or are you still piecing together different subcontractors?

With the Super Bowl coming to Levi's Stadium, the local network demand is going to be unprecedented. Is your property ready?

It also looks like the GC is in place, but the low-voltage/technology partner may not be locked in yet.

I've put together a quick Groove overview that answers the most common questions: what we do, who we serve (hotels, MDU, new construction), why teams pick us (one roof, one point person, fewer headaches), and what happens next.

Check it out here: https://pipelineiq.net/groove-in-45-seconds

This way you can see if we're relevant before we even talk.

If it’s worth a look, happy to do a quick 10 minutes to see if we can help avoid headaches later. If not, no worries.

Best,
Mike

Hi Partner,

I’m not sure if this is relevant to you right now, but I noticed Downtown Dallas Luxury in Dallas, TX is moving into Design.

Typically, when teams get into planning/design, the “vendor sprawl” problem starts.

Are you already set with a unified plan to handle Wi‑Fi/internet, TV, access control, and low‑voltage — or are you still piecing together different subcontractors?

With the World Cup coming to your backyard, international travelers will expect flawless connectivity. Is your infrastructure ready for the world stage?

It also looks like the GC is in place, but the low-voltage/technology partner may not be locked in yet.

Hi Partner,

I’m not sure if this is relevant to you right now, but I noticed Orlando Resort in Orlando, FL is moving into Construction.

Typically, when projects hit this stage, coordination is where change orders show up.

Are you already set with a unified plan to handle Wi‑Fi/internet, TV, access control, and low‑voltage — or are you still piecing together different subcontractors?

Especially with March Madness coming up in the spring, residents are going to be streaming heavily. Are you ready for the bandwidth spike?

It also looks like the GC is in place, but the low-voltage/technology partner may not be locked in yet.
