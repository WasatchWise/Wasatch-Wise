# Mission Control: Pilot's Manual

**Pilot:** Mike Sartain | **Role:** Business Development | **Ship:** Groove Revenue Engine

## 🚀 Your Morning Launch Sequence

Every morning, open the [Dashboard](/dashboard). You will see a prioritized **Focus Feed**.

### 1. The Focus Feed (Your Radar)

This feed tells you exactly who to talk to and why.

- **New Opportunity (Green):** A "Sure Bet" project (>90 score) that needs initial contact.
  - **Action:** Click **Draft Email** to review and send the first outreach.
- **Hot Lead (Red):** Someone opened your email multiple times.
  - **Action:** Click **Log Call** immediately. They are thinking about you right now.
- **Follow Up (Gray):** A project you bumped into the future that is now due.
  - **Action:** Click **Bump** to visit the project and decide next steps (email again? call?).

### 2. Logging Your Flight Data

When you talk to someone (or hit voicemail), tell the system. This makes the engine smarter.
Use the **Log Call** button.

- **Connected?:**
  - "Meeting Booked" -> Engine marks as success.
  - "Not Interested" -> Engine learns what failed.
  - "Call Back Later" -> Engine snoozes it for you.
- **Voicemail?:** It just logs it and keeps the cadence moving.

### 3. Mission Complete

When you see **"You're all caught up!"**, your prospecting for the day is done.
If you're hungry for more, click **Go Find More Work** to dig into the raw project list.
