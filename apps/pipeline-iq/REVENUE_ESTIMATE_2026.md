# 💰 2026 Revenue Projection: Service-Only Model

**Period:** January 1, 2026 – December 31, 2026
**Model:** $1,000 Commission per Amenity (SaaS Revenue Excluded)
**Growth Engine:** Automated Outreach (6 emails/hour)

## 📉 Conservative Estimate: $458,500

By automating outreach to maintain a consistent flow of leads, we project **$458,500** in commission revenue for 2026. This assumes a conservative conversion funnel where the bottleneck is sales capacity, not lead volume.

### 🧮 The Logic (The Math)

#### 1. Top of Funnel: Automated Outreach

We established a continuous dispatch rate of 6 emails/hour.

* **Daily Volume:** 144 emails
* **Monthly Volume:** ~4,380 emails
* **2026 Total Volume:** **52,560 emails**

#### 2. Engagement (Conservative)

Instead of the 12% meeting rate historically hoped for (which requires warm leads), we apply a standard **Cold Outreach -> Meeting** conversion rate of **1%**.

* **Meetings Booked:** 52,560 × 1.0% = **525 Meetings**
* *Operational Reality:* This averages ~2 meetings per working day, which is a sustainable load for a single salesperson (Mike).

#### 3. Sales Execution

We use the "Conservative" metrics defined in your `REVENUE_SHARE_PROJECTIONS.md`:

* **Close Rate:** 25% (1 in 4 meetings results in a deal)
  * **Total Deals:** 525 × 25% = **131 New Customer Buildings**
* **Deal Size:** 3.5 Amenities per Customer (Avg. of WiFi, Cabling, Security)
  * **Total Amenities Sold:** 131 × 3.5 = **458.5 Amenities**

#### 4. Revenue Realization

* **Commission:** $1,000 per amenity
* **Total 2026 Revenue:** 458.5 × $1,000 = **$458,500**

## 📅 Monthly Cash Flow Projection (Ramp-up)

Assuming a 60-day sales cycle (from email → meeting → close → paperwork → commission), revenue will likely lag slightly behind activity.

| Quarter | Activity | Projected Revenue | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1 (Jan-Mar)** | 13k emails sent | **$60,000** | Ramp-up; closing deals from Q4 '25 + Jan activity. |
| **Q2 (Apr-Jun)** | 13k emails sent | **$110,000** | Pipeline velocity stabilizes. |
| **Q3 (Jul-Sep)** | 13k emails sent | **$140,000** | Peak construction season urgency. |
| **Q4 (Oct-Dec)** | 13k emails sent | **$148,500** | End-of-year budget spend. |
| **TOTAL** | **52.5k sent** | **$458,500** | |

## ⚠️ Variables & Sensitivity

| Scenario | Meeting Rate | Close Rate | Amenities/Deal | **2026 Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative (Modeled)** | **1.0%** | **25%** | **3.5** | **$458,500** |
| **Worst Case** | 0.5% | 20% | 3.0 | **$157,500** |
| **Moderate** | 1.5% | 30% | 4.5 | **$1,063,125** |

### Why this is conservative

1. **Lead Scarcity Ignored:** We assume we can find 52k valid prospects. Construction Wire has ~40k records. By mid-year, we may need to enrich data from secondary sources or re-engage old leads.
2. **Low Meeting Rate:** 1% is a baseline cold-email stat. With PipelineIQ's *personalized* AI, this should be higher.
3. **Excluded Upsell:** Does not account for selling *more* services to the same building later.

## 🏁 Bottom Line

If the system runs 24/7/365 at 6 emails/hour, and the sales team simply maintains a 25% close rate on the meetings generated, you will generate **~$458k** in personal commission in 2026.
