## The Capitol

The Capitol is the top-layer governance for the civilization.

- **Executive**: strategy, charter, roadmap, priorities (what we intend).
- **Legislative**: ordinances/standards (what we require).
- **Judicial**: audits/incidents/rulings (what happened, what we learned, what we enforce).
