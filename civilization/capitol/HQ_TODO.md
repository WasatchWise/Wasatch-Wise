## Backlog

- [ ] **Language translation (i18n) on all sites** — Roll out UI language translation across WasatchWise apps (English + Spanish first). Pattern: `next-intl` for Next.js apps, `react-i18next` for others; per-app message files. See [docs/architecture/I18N_LANGUAGE_TRANSLATION_STRATEGY.md](../../docs/architecture/I18N_LANGUAGE_TRANSLATION_STRATEGY.md). Pilot: Ask Before You App or SLC Trips.

*Add items here when they’re agreed as HQ/cross-app; move to weekly priorities when they’re in focus.*
