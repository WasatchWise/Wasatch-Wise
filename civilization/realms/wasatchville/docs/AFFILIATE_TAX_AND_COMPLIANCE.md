## 1. Tax / 1099

| Programme | 1099 / reporting | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Amazon Associates** | Amazon may issue 1099 (or equivalent) above threshold; payouts reported to IRS. W-9 on file. | See Associates Central → Tax; keep records of earnings. |
| **Awin** | Awin may issue 1099 (or local equivalent) above threshold; payouts reported. Tax info on file in Awin. | See Awin publisher account → Tax / payments. |
| **TikTok** | TikTok Creator/affiliate earnings may be 1099 reportable; follow TikTok tax docs. | Keep records of earnings. |

**WasatchWise:** Treat all affiliate income as reportable. Retain payout statements and programme dashboards (screenshots or exports) per [ORD-0002 Record Retention & Archives](../../../city-hall/ordinances/ORD-0002-record-retention-and-archives.md) – operational (R1) or governance (R2) as appropriate. Do not commit raw tax docs or SSN/TIN to git; store in secure location.
