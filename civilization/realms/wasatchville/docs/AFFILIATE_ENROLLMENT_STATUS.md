# Affiliate / Partner Enrollment Status

**Purpose:** Single source of truth so agents (Cursor, Chrome extension, etc.) know what’s already enrolled. **Do not suggest signup for these programs.**

| Program | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Amazon Associates** | ✅ Enrolled | Account: John C. Lyman Jr. Tag: `wasatchwise20-20`. Creators API eligible. See [AMAZON_ASSOCIATES.md](AMAZON_ASSOCIATES.md). |
| **TikTok (affiliate / Shop / Creator)** | ✅ Enrolled | Already signed up. Focus on content, linking, and metrics—not joining. See [MEDIA_AND_ADVERTISING_SECTOR.md](MEDIA_AND_ADVERTISING_SECTOR.md), [SLCTRIPS_TIKTOK_ANALYSIS.md](SLCTRIPS_TIKTOK_ANALYSIS.md). |
| **Awin (Booking.com, Viator, etc.)** | ✅ Enrolled | Publisher ID `2060961`; Booking.com merchant `6776`. Director of Awin Monetization role active. See [AWIN_MONETIZATION_SECTOR.md](AWIN_MONETIZATION_SECTOR.md). Focus: optimization, merchant expansion, scaling across 10+ platforms. |

**For Chrome extension / any agent:** Assume the above are done. Do not recommend “sign up for Amazon Associates” or “join TikTok affiliate.” Recommend only: payment info (Amazon), linking strategy, product lists, n8n, disclosure, Awin optimization/scaling, and verification.
