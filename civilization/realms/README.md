# Realms (top-level only)

**“Realm” here = one business/client deployment** (e.g. WasatchVille). Each realm is a “city” with its own spec, buildings, and agents.

- **Do put here:** Top-level client realms (WasatchVille, future client deployments).
- **Do not put here:** Audience segments or “realms” that live *inside* an app. Those belong in the app. Example: **Student** is an *audience* of Ask Before You App, not a realm of the civilization—see `apps/ask-before-you-app/docs/AUDIENCES.md`.

Using “realm” only for top-level deployments keeps the word from being overloaded.
