**Known bugs:**
- Adult AI Academy shares WasatchWise nav/header and popup modal. Should have its own identity. Bug, not intentional.
- PipelineIQ homepage is broken (landing pages work fine).

**Revenue infrastructure:**
- Stripe: Wasatch Wise LLC (acct_1RXrCfLRKGH1pF11). $12.31 balance. $0 revenue so far. Products created, checkout wired.
- Awin: Affiliate network for SLC Trips (account 2060961). Joined Betckey, Sparkle GmbH, GoWithGuide US programs.
- Starter Kit $79 Buy Now button is on pricing page. Need to verify checkout flow works and PDFs are deliverable.

## WasatchVille (SimCity Operating Metaphor)
WasatchVille is both a product concept and the internal operating metaphor. Each platform is a "building" in the city. The city_metrics table in Supabase tracks revenue, engagement, and health per building. Two machines run the city: Mac builds the buildings (above ground), PC/ClawdBot runs the utilities (underground). Cloudflare is the utility company.

The vision: if someone else is already building a SimCity-style business dashboard, use theirs. If not, build it and sell it when it's good.

**NotebookLM = The Library.** Each TripKit has its own notebook. Notebooks exist for Rock Salt, education/governance/privacy, and personal demos. NotebookLM is the walled garden source of truth.

## Social & Content
| Platform | Handle | Stats (as of Feb 13, 2026) | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------------------|-------|
| TikTok | @slctrips | 5,462 followers, 43.2K likes | Main content account. Dan the Wasatch Sasquatch mascot. |
| TikTok | @the.rocksalt | (active) | Rock Salt music community |
| TikTok | @adultaiacademy | (active) | Adult AI Academy content |
| TikTok | @soakandsurrender | (active) | WolfTok. Soft smut ASMR, Viking vampire content. 12th project, separate from the 11 platforms. |
| TikTok | @therocksalt.com | 355 followers, 2,180 likes | John's personal TikTok |
| LinkedIn | linkedin.com/in/johnlymanslc/ | 610 followers | Professional profile. Privacy/compliance/AI/EdTech positioning. |

## Financial Picture
| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Mortgage | $2,700/month | Fixed |
| Car payment | $600/month | Fixed |
| Total fixed costs | ~$3,300/month | Before living expenses |
| Unemployment income | $640/week (~$2,560/month) | Requires 4 job applications/week |
| Income gap | ~$740/month | Just to cover fixed costs, before living expenses |
| Target income | $5,000/month | Old salary was $108k/year (~$9k/month) |
| Previous salary | $108,000/year | Reference point |

**Strategy:** Job search and WasatchWise revenue in parallel. Not one or the other. Job search should be automated as much as possible (scan boards, surface matches, help draft 4 apps/week for unemployment compliance). Target roles: privacy, compliance, AI governance, EdTech.

## People
| Person | Context |
|--------|---------|
| Mike Sartain | Friend and bandmate in Starmie (band). PipelineIQ is currently running for him. Not a paying client. PipelineIQ is essentially a sophisticated mail merge with CTA landing page. |
| John's Dad | Works at Salt Lake City International Airport. Lead sign person, in charge of all signage within the airport. Direct connection to SLC Trips' core thesis (the airport as hub). |
| Peter Makowski | Deputy Director at Salt Lake City Corporation. Full name: Peter Edward Makowski. Friend from John's early adulthood. Connection: John worked at SLC Corp (YouthCity) for 10 years (2009-2019). Conversations on Facebook, NOT LinkedIn. John pitched SLCTrips to Peter on 12/5/25: positioned it as a smart guide for residents/visitors, families/small businesses. Mentioned TikTok traction, dad's airport feedback on wayfinding, Olympics window, economy boosters for small towns (Manilla, Eureka), marvel/pokemon universe. Asked for a call/coffee to reconnect. Also mentioned stealing Peter's style guide. Got Booking.com affiliation same day. Peter is in a band called FOR (John invited them to be Rock Salt Radio guests). No reply captured yet. |
| Erin Mendenhall | Salt Lake City Mayor. John has a friendship with her. |

## Key Concepts
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| DAROS | District AI Readiness & Outcomes System (consulting framework). Pricing came from automation/assessment but could be revisited. |
| 8% to 92% | Utah compliance transformation over ~4 years (verified) |
| 150+ LEAs | 41 districts + ~116 charters in Utah public education |
| Shadow AI | Unvetted AI tools used by staff without district knowledge |
| 60-Minute Briefing | Core DAROS consulting format |
| Clarion | Clarion AI Partners (potential integration partner) |
| Dan / Wasatch Sasquatch | Animated mascot for @slctrips TikTok. HeyGen character, ElevenLabs "Liam" voice. NOT a person. John films/creates all content. |
| Xennials | Born 1976-1985. Microgeneration bridging analog and digital. Target audience for Adult AI Academy. |
| Holy Trinity | WasatchWise + Ask Before U App + Adult AI Academy (the three core education/governance platforms) |
| Cyrano | AI concierge character in the Daite dating app |
| Booking link | Google Calendar: https://calendar.app.google/9dJThZezeRbb4T486 (ALREADY WIRED into site CTAs) |
| Microtransactions | Preferred revenue model across multiple platforms (tokens, tips, pay-per-feature) |
| ClawdBot | PC-side automation engine (WSL2 + Docker + n8n). COO of WasatchVille. |
| WolfTok | @soakandsurrender. Soft smut ASMR content. 12th project, NOT one of the 11 platforms. Separate thing. |
| Starmie / Starmy | Band that John and Mike Sartain are in together. Resume says "Starmy" but earlier conversation said "Starmie." VERIFY with John which spelling is correct. |
| WiseBot | Vision: platform-specific AI bots. WiseBot on WasatchWise (governance), RockBot on Rock Salt (venues/bands), etc. Each bot knows its domain, acknowledges when it doesn't know, and refers to appropriate resources/people. Not fully built yet. |
| WW Logo | Two Ws that form an "A" (AI) with mountains and a human figure underneath. "Smart Tech, Wiser People." The human is central to the brand. |
| PipelineIQ Flow | ConstructionWire data → Supabase → SendGrid emails → Click tracking → Warm call notification for Mike. Re-engagement loop for non-responders. Smart metrics for email timing/frequency. Could scale to K-12 lead gen or enterprise. |
| Awin | Affiliate network for SLC Trips revenue. Account 2060961. Joined Betckey, Sparkle GmbH, GoWithGuide US. |
| Org Chart | John wants a corporate flow chart before heavy content creation. Who does what, when, who checks in. HITL (human-in-the-loop) for now, refine autonomy as routines get predictable. |
| TripKits | Interactive web experiences (NOT PDFs). Each has: Dan audio narration, progress tracking (visited/wishlist/% complete), destination narratives, Dan's Tips, affiliate links (Book Your Stay, Find Tours), Map View (coming soon). 11 kits, 1,100+ destinations total. |
| 2034 Olympics | SLC Trips has an 8-year vision leading to 2034 Winter Olympics. Gamified experience. Each county has a character. Marvel-style stories with Easter eggs and collectibles. Ties to 4th grade curriculum. Can direct tourists to small Utah towns as economic engine. |
| AzuraCast | Rock Salt's 24/7 radio streaming platform. Could be used for podcasts, AI-generated content, etc. |
| SLC Airport | SLC is uniquely positioned: 12-hour drive in any direction reaches every type of ecology on the continent. This is SLC Trips' core thesis. |
| Rock Salt Vision | "If you saw it on a billboard, you'd go there for music in Utah." Joining bands, teaching music, listening, events, hiring for weddings. THE music destination. |
| FOR / Form of Rocket | Peter Makowski's band. Already on The Rock Salt platform. John invited them to be guests on Rock Salt Radio (Dec 2025 Facebook msg). |
| Booking.com | SLC Trips affiliate. John got affiliation around Dec 5, 2025. |
| NEPQ | Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questions. Sales framework used in DAROS outreach emails and SellBible. Situation question first, surface a felt problem, offer a path forward. |
| SellBible | Behavioral psychology playbook. 4-chemical neurochemical stack. Dual-process (System 1 emotional, System 2 rational). Applied to SLCTrips and Rock Salt. |
| Mt. Olympians | Identity architecture for SLCTrips (from SellBible). Character-based engagement layer. |
| P0 Fires (Launch) | SLCTrips chatbot broken, TripKit count mismatch, DEMO prefix on production TripKits. From Launch_Readiness_Report (Feb 13). |

## Writing Preferences
- **No em dashes** unless part of a deliberate design choice. They're an AI tell.
- No other obvious AI markers (e.g., "delve", "landscape", "leverage", "Moreover", "Furthermore")
- LinkedIn posts: 150-250 words, line breaks for readability, CTA at end, 3-5 hashtags
- Tone: direct, builder mentality, practitioner voice (not consultant-speak)
- Ship over polish. Real talk over corporate language.

## ⚠️ DOCUMENT ACCURACY AUDIT (Feb 15, 2026)
Multiple sales docs have conflicting stats. Before any doc goes out, fix these:
| Issue | What Docs Say | Verified Truth |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Timeline | "under 90 days" (Proposal), "18 months" (Case Study) | ~4 years for John's involvement. Program total was 0 to 92 over 6 years. |
| Charter count | "139 charters" (One-Pager, Proposal) | ~116 charters (fluctuates yearly). Use "150+ LEAs" as the umbrella number. |
| Professional tier price | $9,800 (One-Pager, Proposal, Pricing Sheet) | $9,500 on live website. Pick one and make them match. |
| LEA total | "157 Districts & Charters" (Case Study) | Use "150+ LEAs" per verified stats. |

**Action needed:** These docs are 90% ready. Fix the stats, and they're shippable. The underlying content and design are professional.

## Accuracy Rules
- Always use "150+ LEAs" (not 157, not 180)
- Always say "~4 years" for John's involvement (not 18 months, not 6 years)
- Dan is a CHARACTER, not a person. John creates all content.
- The booking link is Google Calendar (already wired). Not Cal.com.
- WasatchWise consulting is NOT limited to K-12. It can serve attorneys, HR, finance, and other verticals.
- John is a solo founder. No co-founders, no partners on any platform.
- When in doubt about a fact, ASK. Do not assume or hallucinate.
