2. **Focus on WasatchWise** - It's your revenue engine, manual delivery works
3. **Start marketing WasatchWise** - Generate consulting leads

### Short-Term (Weeks 1-3):
4. **Build ONE backend** (whichever you can deliver faster)
5. **Launch that brand** with full functionality
6. **Start generating revenue** from that brand

### Medium-Term (Weeks 4-6):
7. **Build second backend**
8. **Launch second brand**
9. **Set up automation** for cross-brand upsells
