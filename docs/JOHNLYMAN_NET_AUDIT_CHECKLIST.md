## Audit Results — February 11, 2026

**Sections:** ✅ Lyman Land, Privacy Perimeter (150+ districts), Imagineer's Workshop (200+ programs), plus Tomorrowland Terrace, Center Stage — all working.  
**Broken links:** ✅ None found (3 total links; WasatchWise → wasatchwise.com works).  
**150+ districts:** ✅ Stated in Welcome & Bio, Privacy Perimeter zone, and detailed story; achievements and dates documented.  
**WasatchWise CTA:** ⚠️ **Needs improvement.** Link exists in nav under "FUTURE" (Soon badge) and modal; no prominent homepage CTA.

**Recommendation:** Add a visible homepage CTA, e.g. *"Consulting with school districts? Learn about WasatchWise →"* — as a top banner, floating button, text in the Welcome modal, or in the Coming Soon area — so visitors don't have to search the menu to find the WasatchWise connection.
