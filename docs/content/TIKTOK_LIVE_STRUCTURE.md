# TikTok Live — Structure & Run of Show

**Goal:** Repeatable format so each Live has a clear shape. Use when you're ready to go live; adjust as you learn.

**Brand:** **Adult AI Academy (AAA)** is the best fit for TikTok. Audience = adults and educators who want AI literacy in short, digestible form. WasatchWise stays the consulting brand; TikTok drives discovery and trust toward AAA (and optionally to WasatchWise for districts later).

## Before You Go Live

- [ ] **Topic** — Pick one (see AAA topic ideas below). One idea per Live.
- [ ] **One sentence** — "Today I'm talking about [X] — why it matters if you're using AI at work or with students."
- [ ] **Link in bio** — Point to **adultaiacademy.com** (or wasatchwise.com/adult-ai-academy while AAA site is there). Say it at the start and end.
- [ ] **Length** — Decide in advance: 10 min, 15 min, or 20 min. Set a timer.

## Run of Show (template)

| Segment | Time | What to do |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Hook** | 0:00–0:30 | "Hey, [name]. Adult AI Academy — quick take on [topic]. One thing that trips people up when they use AI [at school / at work]. Then I'll take questions." |
| **Main take** | 0:30–5:00 | One clear idea. 2–3 bullets. No more than three points. Keep it practical: "here's what to do" or "here's what to avoid." |
| **CTA** | 5:00–5:30 | "Link in bio — Adult AI Academy, free resources / course preview. Drop a comment if you want [one specific thing]." |
| **Q&A or repeat** | 5:30–end | Answer comments, or restate the main take in different words. Keep saying the link in bio. |
| **Outro** | Last 30 sec | "That's it for today. Link in bio — Adult AI Academy. See you next [day/time]." |

## Topic ideas (AAA — AI literacy for adults & educators)

- **What is AI, actually?** — Demystify in 60 seconds: not magic, not sentient; pattern-matching + prediction. Why that matters for how we use it.
- **One prompt trick that changes how you use ChatGPT** — e.g. "act as a [role]" or "give me 3 options." Simple, shareable.
- **AI for lesson planning** — Do's and don'ts. What to keep human; what's safe to draft with AI.
- **Why "AI literacy" isn't just for kids** — Educators and parents need it first. Short take, then Q&A.
- **FERPA / COPPA in plain English** — What educators need to know before putting student data into any tool. (Bridges to WasatchWise for districts.)
- **Bias and AI** — One example (e.g. hiring, grading, recommendations). How to spot it and what to do.
- **Free vs. paid AI tools** — Where your data goes. Why it matters for school or work.

When you publish an AAA or WasatchWise blog post, that post can become the next Live topic; keep the angle "AI literacy for adults/educators" so it stays AAA on TikTok.

---

## Cadence (optional)

- **Once a week** — e.g. same day/time so people can habit-stack (e.g. "Every Thursday 12pm MT").
- **Or** — twice a month until it feels easy, then weekly.

---

## After the Live

- [ ] Note what got the most comments or questions — that's a future post or TikTok clip.
- [ ] If you saved the Live, pin or repost one short clip as a TikTok video with a caption that drives to link in bio.

**Keep it simple:** Same structure every time. Swap only the topic and the one-sentence hook. Link in bio every time.

**WasatchWise on TikTok:** You can still mention "we work with school districts on AI governance" when it's relevant (e.g. FERPA/COPPA Live) — that builds credibility and can send district leads to wasatchwise.com. But the *channel* and the *offer* in the bio are AAA: AI literacy for adults and educators.
