# WasatchWise Brand Portfolio Positioning

**Last updated:** January 29, 2026  
**Maintained by:** Cursor + Chrome Extension agents

---

## Overview

Three brands under the WasatchWise umbrella — the **Holy Trinity**: WasatchWise, Adult AI Academy, Ask Before You App. Each has equal stature, its own audience and offer, and when users are in one brand’s experience (e.g. AAA), that brand’s logo and identity lead (e.g. AAA logo in nav, Smart Tech • Wiser People).

## Brand Matrix

| Brand | Primary Audience | Core Focus | Key Differentiators |
|-------|------------------|------------|----------------------|
| **WasatchWise** | School districts, educational institutions (enterprise) | AI compliance, governance consulting, district-level policy implementation | FERPA-safe workflows, board-approved policies, 90-Day Protocol, Cognitive Audit |
| **Ask Before You App** | K-12 schools, higher ed institutions, parents | App safety, AI detection, privacy audits for educational ecosystems | Tool vetting, student data protection, educator/parent resources |
| **Adult AI Academy** | General adults (Gen X, Xennials, career professionals, reluctant learners) | AI literacy and upskilling for everyday use | No tech jargon, real-world applications, privacy-conscious, non-educator-specific |

### Visual identity (Adult AI Academy)
- **Page palette:** Bluish-gray (Tailwind `slate`) for backgrounds, borders, and accents—aligns with the AAA logo background and a calmer, adult-learning feel. Less orange than WasatchWise.
- **Orange** reserved for primary CTAs only (e.g. Get Started, modal primary button) to keep conversion clear and tie to parent brand.

## Messaging Guidelines

### What to avoid
- **Don't** use K-12 educator language (lesson planning, assessment, FERPA) on Adult AI Academy
- **Don't** use enterprise compliance language (governance, board approval) on Ask Before You App
